I really need you
I really need your love right now
I'm fading fast
Not gonna last
I'm really stupid
I'm burning up, I'm going down
I win it back
Don't even ask
When I found myself in the middle, in the middle, in the middle
Could you love me more, just a little, just a little
Overcomplicate when it's simple, when it's simple, when it's simple
Would you love me more, just a little

So tell me now
When every star falls from the sky
And every last heart in the world breaks
Oh hold me now
When every ship is going down
I don't feel nothing when I hear you say

It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK

I'm really sorry
Sorry I dragged you into this
I only think, that's all it is
The way you love me
The way you love me 'til the end
The way you love me
Oh yeah, it makes me king again

When I found myself in the middle, in the middle, in the middle
Could you love me more, just a little, just a little
Overcomplicate when it's simple, when it's simple, when it's simple
Would you love me more, just a little

So tell me now
When every star falls from the sky
And every last heart in the world breaks
Oh hold me now
When every ship is going down
I don't feel nothing when I hear you say

It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK

It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK

It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK

When every ship is going down
I don't feel nothing when I hear you say
It's gonna be OK
